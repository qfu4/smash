		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>
			Three of the most well-known streaming services are Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube TV. All of these allow you to watch what you want, when you want it. All three of these services specialize in a diferent focus though. Netflix is based more on movies and now on it's own produced content, Hulu is more focused on shows, and Youtube TV is focused on live TV. All of there services have started to bleed into eachother's area of expertise in a bid to take over the entire market. These three show the progression of online streaming services, from Netflix streaming movies made in previous years, to Hulu uploading tv shows shortly after they aired on TV, to Youtube TV where the shows are instantly online as they air.
