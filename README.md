##Philosopher

#Typography
I used typefaces "philosopher" and "playfair display" because
  1) according to Google Font, they pair well
  2) the domain/subject of the webpage is Greek philosophers. 
     Greek philosophers give me a sense of balance, peace, and wisdom.
     the typeface "philosopher" conveys a balance of vertical and horizontal stretch
     the arms look smooth, making me feel comfortable and peaceful
I made the first letter of each paragraph a drop cap letter because
  1) this remainds me of the style of those classics
  2) this is also a reason why I used the typeface "playfair display": the typeface matches the drop cap style very well


#Readability
1) I made h1 bigger than all other h2s, made h2s the same size and color because these consistency and contrast can help readers figure out the structure and organization of the content.

2) I added border lines between each paragraph so that readers can easily figure out the start and end of each section of the content

3) I added a contrast but not akward color to the hover, so that readers can recognize the clickable link.

4) I used colors that can match each other very well and chose the colors that can reflect the nature of Greek philosopher: pure and peace

5) I did not place anything side by side because I want to create the continuous feeling of reading an article from a classical book

6) I added background color because I want to emphasize that there is a navigation bar with a clickable item.

7) Since the texts for the source links are very short, I added space between them and added borders because I want to separated them clearly so that readers understand that they are three independent links.
